-struct type for stages with each stage
-Hash table using the 8-3 bits ass array addresses,
    *for changing size of predicion table, add or take away a bit from instruction to store
    *2-bit predictor stores 0-3, 1 bit 0 or 1
?proffessor will be emailed about how to handle and instruction flow, finding brancing instructions
    *Changing type to "squashed" when a branch prediciton in incorrect
-forwardng can just come from reading instructions from the above struct

?Is there any difference in execution between IF1/IF2, and MEM1/MEM2?

-function
    *Detecting hazards
        #Write back harzard (insert no-op before reading register)
        #ALU Hazards (Looking ahead at memory)
